❌ Resource with ID Not Found not found
   [NOT_FOUND] (HTTP 404)

   This usually means:
   • The resource was recently deleted
   • You're looking in the wrong context/instance
   • The ID was mistyped or uses wrong format
   • The resource exists but you lack read permissions

   Try:
   n8n --help                      # See all commands
